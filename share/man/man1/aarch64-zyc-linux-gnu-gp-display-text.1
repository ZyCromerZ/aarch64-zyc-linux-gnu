.SH COMMANDS
.PP
This tool supports a rich set of commands to control the display of the
data; instead of, or in addition to, including these commands in a script
file, it is also allowed to include such commands at the command line;
in this case, the commands need to be prepended with the "\-" symbol; the
commands are processed and interpreted left from right, so the order matters;
The gprofng manual documents the commands that are supported.
.PP
If this tool is invoked without options, commands, or a script file, it starts
in interpreter mode. The user can then issue the commands interactively; the
session is terminated with the "exit" command in the interpreter.
.PP
.SH DOCUMENTATION
.PP
A getting started guide for gprofng is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If the info and
gprofng programs are properly installed at your site, the command "info gprofng"
should give you access to this document.
